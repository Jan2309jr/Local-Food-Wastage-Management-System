# üç≤ Local Food Wastage Management System

## üìå Overview

Food wastage is a global challenge, where surplus food often goes to waste while millions of people face hunger and food insecurity. This project tackles the issue by building a **Local Food Wastage Management System** using **Python, SQL, and Streamlit**.

The system allows:

* **Providers** (restaurants, grocery stores, individuals) to list surplus food.
* **Receivers** (NGOs, community centers, individuals) to claim the food.
* **Admins** to manage providers, receivers, food listings, and claims using CRUD operations.
* **Data analysis** via SQL queries and EDA to uncover wastage patterns and improve efficiency.

This project demonstrates the integration of **data engineering, analysis, and app development** to create a solution for **waste reduction** and **social good**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Learned

* Python programming
* SQL database design & querying
* CRUD operations implementation
* Data cleaning and preparation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Streamlit app development
* Dashboard & visualization

---

## üåç Domain

* **Food Management**
* **Waste Reduction**
* **Social Good / Community Welfare**

---

## üö® Problem Statement

Food wastage is widespread. Restaurants and households discard edible surplus food daily, while many individuals and NGOs struggle to access sufficient food.
This project develops a **centralized system** to:

* Connect **food providers** with **receivers**.
* Reduce waste by redistributing surplus food efficiently.
* Provide **analytics & insights** into wastage trends.

---

## üí° Business Use Cases

* Efficient redistribution of surplus food.
* Transparency and accountability in donations.
* Insights into trends for **policy-making** and **donation drives**.
* Support for **NGOs and communities** to access food easily.

## How to run locally

```bash
# 1) Install all dependancies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2) Initialize DB and load CSVs (put your 4 CSVs under data/ with the exact names)
python data/database/load_data.py
# 3) Launch Streamlit
pythom -m streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

### Notes
- Uses **SQLite** (`food.db`) for simplicity. Switch to PostgreSQL/MySQL by replacing the connection helpers.
- Ensure your CSV headers match the dataset description.

## üîé Approach

### 1. **Data Preparation**

* Collected CSV datasets for **providers, receivers, food listings, and claims**.
* Cleaned and formatted data for consistency.

### 2. **Database Creation**

* Designed SQL schema for 4 key entities:

  * Providers
  * Receivers
  * Food Listings
  * Claims
* Populated data into SQL tables.

### 3. **Data Analysis**

* Wrote **15 SQL queries** to answer key business questions.
* Performed **EDA** to visualize provider types, food types, and wastage trends.

### 4. **Application Development (Streamlit)**

* Developed an **interactive dashboard**:

  * Filter available food by **city, provider type, food type, and meal type**.
  * Show contact details for providers.
  * CRUD operations for managing data.
  * SQL query outputs with insights.

### 5. **Deployment**

* Streamlit app deployed for real-time interaction and accessibility.
